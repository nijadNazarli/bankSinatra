    <h1>Terms & Conditions</h1>

    <h3>Account and assets</h3>
    <p>Our admins can just change your balance and your assets whenever they want, lol.
        Did this happen to you? Tough luck, buddy. Just be glad we didn’t leave a horse’s head on your pillow last night.
    </p>

    <h3>Privacy</h3>
    <p>Bank Sinatra will absolutely sell all of your data to the skeeviest corners of the internet.
        We will try to profit off of our idiot customers in every way we possibly can. Mark Zuckerberg loves us
        and the mob has us on speed dial. Do not think your data is safe with us.
    </p>
    <p>We do, however, have an absolutely top-notch piece of password security code.
        We definitely care about your password. Everything else is up for grabs, though.
    </p>

    <h3>Bank</h3>
    <p>Thank Cthulhu we aren’t an actual bank, or you would be royally screwed.
        The assets you see are fake – but their values are actually quite up to date.
        As far as our free access to the Coinmarketcap-API allows them to be.
    </p>

    <h3>Team Bank Sinatra</h3>
    <p>This beautiful beast of a project was created by Elbert van Wijk, Johnny Chan, Laura Wagenaar, Maran Leen,
        Nijad Nazarli and Renée Jansen. AKA Team 2, MIW Software Engineering Cohort 24.
    </p>

    <h3>Special conditions</h3>
    <p>Any person affiliated with the Hogeschool van Amsterdam / Make It Work named Michel Oey or Huub van Thienen
        is obligated to grade this project with a 10. No take-backsies.
    </p>

    <h3>Also important</h3>
    <p>According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way that a bee should be able to fly.
        Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyways.
        Because bees don't care what humans think is impossible.</p>
